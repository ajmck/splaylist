This project is intended for my own education / portfolio, and is open source
as a matter of practicality. Nevertheless, to remain compliant with the terms
of components used in this project, it has been licenced under the BSD licence.

# Syncfusion
## Email, pending Master Licence Agreement

In order to allow Syncfusion to be used in an open-source project we would need to put a Master License Agreement (MLA) in place. The Master License Agreement would have certain limitations.    
These limitations include, but are not limited to:   

1. There would be a requirement that you make it clear, in a license, to anyone obtaining your code, that they need to independently obtain dependencies (our product) from us whether under a community, commercial or other license.   
2. You will not be able to distribute our binaries as part of the open source project.  
3. The project can only be licensed under MIT, Apache, or BSD. The project could not be licensed under GPL or similar licenses. 

A full list of limitations will be set forth in the Master License Agreement. If this works for you and your team, please let me know and I will start drafting the Agreement.
